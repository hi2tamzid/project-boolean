Project 01
- Every year, supervisor is assigned for final project. Students form their
own group consisting of 3 members (maximum). A platform is to be
developed which will help the supervisor. A supervisor can enter the
details (group members info, project info etc.). By this platform, a
supervisor will be able to:
 See how many groups have completed their projects. Also, can
view the details (like: year/date completed, grade achieved,
marks for each category etc.)
o See the upcoming groups who are nearly at the final stage
